# Field Notes

This note keeps the observability assumptions visible beside the checks.

The domain cases cover `span volume`, `latency skew`, `signal loss`, and `incident shape`. They sit beside the smaller starter fixture so the project has both a compact scoring check and a domain-flavored review check.

The widest spread is between `span volume` and `signal loss`, so those are the first two cases I would preserve during a refactor.

The point is not to make the repository bigger. The point is to make the important judgment testable.
